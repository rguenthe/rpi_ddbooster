/**
 * @brief Class acts as a wrapper around SPI calls to control the Digi-Dot-Booster.
 *
 * After creation of the class instance SPI is configured with default values (12MHz, MSB first, mode 0).
 * By default the library uses the SS pin of the Arduino platform for the communication with the Digi-Dot-Booster.
 * If you prefer to use another digital pin for chip select use configurePins to set it.
 * Using configurePins you can also set a reset pin used to toggle the hardware reset of the DD-Booster.
 *
 * Before calling any functions you have first to initialize the DD-Booster by calling init() with the number of the LEDs (max. 256),
 * their type (RGB or RGBW) and the color order (RGB or GRB). Both last parameters are optional - DD-Booster is
 * configured for the ws2812 LEDS (RGB type with GRB color order).
 *
 * When calling the functions the corresponding values are sent to the DD-Booster, but only
 * after the show() call the LEDs are really addressed with the current state of the values buffer.
